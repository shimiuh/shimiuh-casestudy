Welcome to the A Case-Study! 

This project is designed to serve as a representative model of the end-to-end engineering process for an intervew. 

The project has the following phases:

1. You receive access to this repository, which contains this README and a [specification document](spec.md) that describes the project.
2. We meet for 10m - 15m to discuss the specification document and resolve any questions.
3. You independently work on code that aims to fulfill the specification document.
4. We expect a reasonable solution to take at least 5 hours. You may spend more time as needed. This is the only technical round we have. Make sure to highlight areas of your depth and any bredth. 
5. We meet for 1.5h to discuss the code you've written in an open-ended way: particular implementation choices you made, changing requirements, etc.

Goals of this project:

1. We see how you work within a representative environment on representative problems.
2. We see how you think and write code.

Non-goals of this project:

1. We do not expect code that fulfills all aspects of the spec! Please do not spend more than a day of your time on this. The intent is to understand how you think about problems and write code, not whether you can implement a spec end to end in limited time.
2. We do not expect a production-ready code base. Please feel free to "cut corners" where appropriate: data persistence, infrastructure, and polished front-end design are all areas that could be ignored (or, focused on, if that's your thing!).
